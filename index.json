For a typical production line setting, the machines are subject to random breakdown and restart besides blockage and starvation, and they are usually connected via buffer areas with finite capacity. In the present study, the energy consumption of the serial production line with two Bernoulli machines is considered, with an aim to minimize the total energy consumption under a desired production rate. The energy consumption of the two machine system is composed of the energy needed to set up, for keeping machines idle, and for actual manufacturing. In order to minimize the total energy expenditure, a nonlinear fractional polynomial optimization model is constructed, which is first converted to a nonlinear polynomial optimization problem. Then the property of the total energy cost is analyzed via the sum of squares (SOS) method. To speed up the solving process, a new heuristic approach named ECS-algorithm is proposed considering the monotonicity and local optimality of the energy cost function. Finally, by presenting optimal configurations of the production line with different throughputs, buffer capacities, and energy parameters, a simulation based study is performed to validate the SOS and ECS algorithms.\n","date":1650844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650844800,"objectID":"6bb4a39d6b38482547ac4b4fc319eaa1","permalink":"/post/22-04-25-ijpr-accepted-wang/","publishdate":"2022-04-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-04-25-ijpr-accepted-wang/","section":"post","summary":"恭喜王玉娟、杨佩琪投稿IJPR的论文被接收。\n","tags":null,"title":"Congratulations to Yujuan Wang and Peiqi Yang for Paper Acceptance","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zhi Pei","",""],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1650844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630649951,"objectID":"67f84d5b15c0a6237035d7bb60d6e149","permalink":"/publication/pei-2022-energy/","publishdate":"2022-04-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pei-2022-energy/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, the topic of sustainable manufacturing system design with energy saving features has received increasing attention.

The drone delivery system aims to reduce the labor cost in the current labor-intensive courier industry, as well as avoid the disturbance caused by geographic and demographic features. For the drone delivery service providers to survive and prosper, a pool of shared drones is integrated into the ecological chain, where the courier service providers focus on the delivery operations. For such a drone sharing system, revenue management becomes vital in terms of pricing, drone hiring cost, and service-related cost. To better depict the system dynamics, in the present paper, a time-varying and price-sensitive queueing model is formulated, where the customer behaviors are taken into account, such as balking and abandonment. To guarantee a preset service level, the probability of abandonment and expected delay are considered as the control targets, and the pricing for courier service and the maintained fleet size are considered simultaneously. For the low and moderate quality of service(QoS) target, a fluid control model is constructed with a closed-form solution. For the high QoS target, a modified approximation algorithm is designed to numerically tackle the problem. Based on the simulation, it is observed that the proposed approximation methods not only provide a high-quality joint strategy but also help stabilize the system performance. In addition, only mild price change is needed to reach the optimal condition, and a time lag exists between the optimal fleet sizing and the demand variation, which may shed light on the demand-driven fleet sizing under more general settings.","tags":[],"title":"Managing price and fleet size for courier service with shared drones","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Prof. Wenzhu Zhang for her paper was accepted by the European Journal of Operational Research.\nTitle Frequency competition among airlines on coordinated airports network\nAbstract Frequency competition is critical for a full-service airline in gaining market share, and adopting a proper strategy can improve an airline’s profits.

Recently, an increased number of e-commerce companies implement the unmanned smart warehouses to improve the logistics efficiency. In order to further reduce the demand response time, a novel picking strategy is designed to firstly split the orders, and then assign the partial orders to different pickers. After all the order segments have been collected, it is shipped to the customer. Due to the inherent complexity of the problem, a two stage optimization model is introduced. In the first stage, an order splitting and batching strategy based on spatial measure is proposed. And a MIP model is constructed to minimize the total picking distance, which is then solved via a column generation based algorithm. In the second stage, the newly formed batches are considered as a priori inputs, which are then assigned to automatic pickers. The picking process is modeled as a special parallel machine scheduling problem with multiple due dates for a single item, which could reduce to a customer order scheduling problem on parallel machines, and it is unary NP-complete. A heuristic method is proposed to obtain an approximate solution. Although the order splitting technique is not new in the logistics industry, the split orders are picked according to a vehicle routing problem, which fails to address the kitting issue for fast turnovers. In the numerical analysis section, the proposed algorithm is validated through extensive testing on various scales of instances. It is observed that the optimality gap for our algorithm is within 9%, and the computation time is around 5 min. Also, the average turnover rate increases by approximately 50% in comparison with the no-splitting policy. In most cases, the average order tardiness decreases by 90% compared with order splitting and no-kitting policy.","tags":[],"title":"Spatial and temporal optimization for smart warehouses with fast turnover","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yong Chen","Feiyang Yu","Ziwen Cheng","Qiuxia Jin","Zhi Pei","Wenchao Yi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1594080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630649951,"objectID":"4efeca4a217f351cb4119e7af69efb47","permalink":"/publication/chen-2020-academic/","publishdate":"2020-07-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2020-academic/","section":"publication","summary":"The cellular automata algorithm is one of the most important developments recently and is becoming an area of great potential in scheduling problems.

In this work, an unrelated parallel manufacturing setting with time-of-use (TOU) electricity price is explored, with an aim to reduce the electricity cost and increase productivity simultaneously. A nonlinear mathematical programming model is formulated to exploit the special structure of the scheduling problem, where the quadratic constraints are reformulated as second-order-cone (SOC) constraints, and several tailored cutting planes are introduced to further tighten the feasible region of the problem. Then, the original scheduling problem is transformed into several single-machine scheduling problems with TOU electricity price, which could be relaxed as a single-objective programming problem, and it could be solved rapidly via commercial solvers, such as CPLEX. Based on the optimal solution of the relaxed problem, an approximate algorithm is proposed, where a special rounding technique is employed to assign jobs to the unrelated parallel machines in a local search manner. Furthermore, a lower bound model is constructed by eliminating the nonpreemption constraint, and an iteration-based algorithm is devised to obtain the optimal solution of the lower bound problem. Meanwhile, a dispatch rule-based approach is proposed to provide an upper bound of the scheduling problem with TOU constraint. In the numerical analysis section, the proposed approximate algorithm is validated through extensive testing on various scales of instances, different emphasis on productivity and electricity price, and under two typical TOU electricity pricing policies. It is observed that the gap between the proposed approximate algorithm and CPLEX is mostly within 4%, and the lower/upper bound methods could obtain a relaxed/feasible solution within 0.01 s. Note to Practitioners —Energy saving together with productivity improvement in the manufacturing system becomes the focus of both academia and industry over the years due to the increasing deterioration of the environment and the advancement of commercialization. In order to maintain better social welfare, the government usually makes time-of-use (TOU) electricity pricing policies to rebalance energy demand. For each manufacturing company, a tradeoff analysis should be performed to adapt to the TOU electricity price, so as to achieve the most desirable outcome. During the decision-making process, the practitioners should assign weights to the productivity and the energy cost to match their anticipation. For a typical manufacturing setting where all the machines are unrelated parallel, the proposed approximate algorithm, also known as the F-SOC algorithm, could be employed to obtain a near-optimal schedule within a short period of time. The proposed approximate algorithm could also work well in situations where the TOU electricity pricing policies are switching, and the preferences for productivity versus energy cost are swaying. A near-optimal schedule could always be guaranteed within a 4% gap from the optimal solution for most cases.","tags":[],"title":"An Approximation Algorithm for Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Under TOU Electricity Tariffs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenzhu Zhang","Yue Dai","Lin Tian"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1589932800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630649954,"objectID":"9978f5ee538564ac2e48e823cca00b01","permalink":"/publication/zhang-2021-pricing/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-2021-pricing/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we analyze the impact of indirect network effects and competition on two firms each offering two complementary products.

Furthermore, we examine a model with two symmetric firms each having a major product and a minor product, where the major product of one firm is the minor one of the other. We find that the impacts of network effects of major and minor products on the equilibrium prices are not symmetric. Moreover, as the substitution rate increases, the firm might partially sacrifice the major product market to boost the minor product market when the substitution rate is low and the network effect of the minor product is quite weak compared to that of the major product. Our numerical analysis shows that strong externalities between the two complementary products will benefit the firms.

In the newly proposed algorithm, the original scheduling problem is divided into several sub-problems based on release dates. For each sub-problem, a convex quadratic integer programming model is constructed in accordance with the specific problem structure. Then a semi-definite programming approach is implemented to produce a lower bound via the semi-definite relaxation of each sub-problem. Furthermore, by considering the binary constraint, a branch and bound based method and a local search strategy are applied separately to locate the optimal solution of each sub-problem. Then the solution of the original scheduling problem is derived by integrating the outcomes of the sub-problems via the proposed approximation algorithm. In the numerical analysis, it is discovered that the proposed methods could always obtain a scheduling result within 1% of the optimal solution. And an asymptotic trend could be observed where the quality of solutions improves even further as the scale of the scheduling problem increases.","tags":[],"title":"A new approximation algorithm for unrelated parallel machine scheduling with release dates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yong Chen","Qiuxia Jin","Hui Fang","Hui Lei","Jiarui Hu","Yanqi Wu","Jie Chen","Cheng Wang","Yuehua Wan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1562025600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630649950,"objectID":"328861239bdb98adac0968dd1ba7dfde","permalink":"/publication/chen-2019-analytic/","publishdate":"2019-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2019-analytic/","section":"publication","summary":"Diversity multi-criteria decision-making methods have been developed to address different complex decision-making problems, and the analytic network process has been found to be one of the most effective techniques.

Therefore, the most important variable is to determine when the reminders should to be sent. In this paper, we study the optimal appointment reminder sending strategy for a single service scenario with customer no-show behaviour. Through discretising the decision process, a dynamic programming model is formulated. Then the optimal time to send a reminder for each appointment is calculated. We prove that there exists an optimal time to send a reminder for each appointment and that the earlier an appointment is made, the earlier a reminder should be sent. Furthermore, our numerical studies show that there exists an optimal appointment time window for a service with a given arrival rate and no-show rate. In addition, the higher the no-show rate of a customer is, the later a reminder should be sent. Based on the optimal reminder sending strategy, the expected service utilisation can be improved compared to no reminders or sending reminders 24 h before the scheduled time.

Within such scaling systems, the verbal information could be illustrated by multiple forms, such as the extended linguistic scale values and the 2-tuple linguistic representation. In general, the fundamental procedure to implement such methods involves the translation of the experts’ verbal judgements into computable linguistic variables, the arithmetic operations of the linguistic variables, and the transformation of the derived outcomes back to the verbal terms. Meanwhile, still many experts prefer presenting their linguistic assessments on an unevenly distributed cardinality in contrast with the evenly distributed sets. In light of the mission “computing with words”, it is essential to design a unified way to model the linguistic scale sets with both evenly and unevenly distributed cardinalities. Since the normal distribution serves as a decent tool to model the subjective judgements, in the present paper, a series of normal distribution based unbalanced linguistic scale sets are constructed. Besides, the area blocks under the distribution curve are applied to bridge the unbalanced linguistic variables and their relative coordinates. Furthermore, a novel 3-tuple format of unbalanced linguistic variable representation is proposed. The 3-tuple model is a generalized form of the linguistic information, and it could further degenerate to its 2-tuple linguistic counterpart. Finally, two numerical examples are included to demonstrate the validity of the proposed unbalanced linguistic variable based models and the 3-tuple linguistic information representation approach.","tags":[],"title":"New unbalanced linguistic scale sets: The linguistic information representations and applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhi Pei"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1479945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630649952,"objectID":"986b8427735a3273eb5d67b22c995b74","permalink":"/publication/pei-2017-multi/","publishdate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pei-2017-multi/","section":"publication","summary":"Intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) point operators transform an intuitionistic fuzzy set to a fuzzy set, or an intuitionistic fuzzy set with a smaller degree of hesitance.

Unfortunately, “ideal environments” are not always possible. Real systems often encounter some uncertainties which will change the status of manufacturing systems. These may cause the original schedule to no longer to be optimal or even feasible. Traditional scheduling methods are not effective in coping with these cases. Therefore, a new scheduling strategy called “inverse scheduling” has been proposed to handle these problems. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to provide a comprehensive mathematical model for multi-objective permutation flow-shop inverse scheduling problem (PFISP). In this paper, first, a PFISP mathematical model is devised and an effective hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to handle uncertain processing parameters (uncertainties) and multiple objectives at the same time.

In order to encompass uncertain and ambiguous decision elements, an extension of the original TOPSIS method has been coined. With the help of fuzzy sets based TOPSIS, an overwhelming trend of fuzzy decision making applications has been witnessed. In the present work, however, it is found that the extended fuzzy TOPSIS method is unable to distinguish all the different alternatives under linguistic environment. Moreover, the undistinguishable alternatives are countless in quantity, and they have formed specific patterns with respect to the parameters of TOPSIS methods. To dampen this ranking ambiguity, we designed a set of supplemental methods to construct a revised TOPSIS approach with linguistic evaluations. Correspondingly, the sufficiency of the revised TOPSIS method to guarantee total orders has been proven. Furthermore, a numerical example concerning the production line improvement of a manufacturing company is demonstrated to validate the feasibility and supremacy of the proposed method.

In this paper, we will introduce the simplification theory and techniques in fuzzy multiple attribute decision making problems, which incur great costs especially in the production line evaluation process. To solve this problem, two attribute reduction algorithms are proposed. The purpose of the algorithms is to attain all of the simplified order-preserving attribute subsets and the order-preserving attribute core subset of the corresponding multiple attribute decision making problem. Then one of the simplest order-preserving attribute subsets will be employed as a substitute of the original attribute set. Furthermore, via comparison, dissimilarities between the attribute reduction in decision making and the knowledge reduction in rough set theory are discovered. Finally, a case study concerning production line evaluation is analyzed in depth to demonstrate our approach, and also a sensitivity analysis is conducted to reflect the robustness of each attribute reduct.","tags":[],"title":"Simplification of fuzzy multiple attribute decision making in production line evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhi Pei"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1343088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630649952,"objectID":"70d6a945e3be241b71bed78b99093746","permalink":"/publication/pei-2013-rational/","publishdate":"2012-07-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pei-2013-rational/","section":"publication","summary":"In the age of mass customization with service oriented manufacturing, more and more production lines are designed according to the frequently changing customer demands. In order to improve upon the flexible production lines, rapid assessment tools have to be developed and implemented. Since uncertain information and incomplete knowledge coexist inevitably in the rapid assessment process, in literature, fuzzy multi-attribute decision making models are established to handle them simultaneously. However, very few papers have paid adequate attention to the decision maker’s rationality, i.e., the optimism level of the decision maker. Therefore, in this paper, a series of novel rational decision making models are developed in dealing with the multi-attribute assessment problems, which include incomplete preference information. And the evaluating data are expressed under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy settings. Compared with the traditional distance-based method, correlation coefficient between each alternative and the ideal solution with (α, β) optimism level is applied. Furthermore, confidence level and cognitive dissonance of the decision maker are included in the overall decision making process in order to constitute a more comprehensive evaluation of the flexible production line. Besides, several insights are revealed concerning the levels of optimism and the weights of production line attributes. Finally, a three-stage empirical study is conducted to validate the proposed models, compare them with the traditional distance-based methods, and the result shows that our approach is not only valid but also outperforms the traditional methods.","tags":[],"title":"Rational decision making models with incomplete weight information for production line assessment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cheng Wang","Wansheng Tang","Ruiqing Zhao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1335139200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630649953,"objectID":"5c4f21e0a866d1d0ba666192674f6072","permalink":"/publication/wang-2013-infinite/","publishdate":"2012-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2013-infinite/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper studies a dynamic pricing problem for a monopolist selling multiple identical items to potential buyers arriving over time, where the time horizon is infinite, the goods are imperishable and the buyers’ arrival follows a renewal process. Each potential buyer has some private information about his purchasing will, and this private information is unknown to the seller and therefore characterized as a random variable in this paper. Thus, the buyers may have multi-unit demand. Meanwhile, the seller needs to determine the optimal posted price such that his expected discounted revenue is maximized. This problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic programming in this paper and then how to obtain the solution is explored. A numerical study shows that the optimal posted price performs better than that of optimal fixed price, and this advantage becomes obvious as the interest rate and/or the number of initial items increases.","tags":[],"title":"The infinite time horizon dynamic pricing problem with multi-unit demand","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
