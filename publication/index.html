    <a href="/publication/pei-2021-target/">Target-based Distributionally Robust Optimization for Single Machine Scheduling</a>
  </div>

  
  <a href="/publication/pei-2021-target/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>In the traditional single-machine scheduling problem with uncertain processing time, distributionally robust optimization models are established in situations where the distribution information is not known exactly. One well-studied robust optimization method used in scheduling is the distributionally ß-robust optimization technique. The goal of this technique is to maximize the probability that the total flow time of the job sequence does not exceed the predetermined target level T. However, it is possible that the excess value of the total flow time beyond the target T may be incredibly large, and therefore it is necessary to consider the optimized excess value. To address this concern, two new target-based risk measures are introduced. First, target-oriented CVaR, the worst-case conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is used to minimize the excess value beyond T, which accounts for both the excess probability and the excess value. Second, the essential riskiness index (ERI) is extended to a multi-piecewise linear function for excess value control in single-machine scheduling problems. To obtain a tractable closed-form solutions of the risk measures, the CVaR-based measure is decomposed into an assignment problem and a second-order cone programming problem, and the ERI is converted to its equivalent semi-definite programming and second-order cone counterparts. To efficiently solve the risk measures for single-machine scheduling, a bisection search algorithm and a Benders decomposition algorithm are designed. In the numerical analysis, the excess value and the probability are investigated with respect to two distributions, namely the two-point distribution and the truncated normal distribution. The experiment design also considers different ranges of expectation and variance, tolerance levels, and problem scales. It is discovered that the CVaR and ERI-based methods are always better than the distributionally ß-robust scheduling approach in terms of excess value.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>With the rapid development of modern logistics systems, the unmanned aerial vehicle (a.k.a. drone) based delivery service emerges as a technology-driven innovation, and it is now pilot running in many regions across the globe. The drone delivery system aims to reduce the labor cost in the current labor-intensive courier industry, as well as avoid the disturbance caused by geographic and demographic features. For the drone delivery service providers to survive and prosper, a pool of shared drones is integrated into the ecological chain, where the courier service providers focus on the delivery operations. For such a drone sharing system, revenue management becomes vital in terms of pricing, drone hiring cost, and service-related cost. To better depict the system dynamics, in the present paper, a time-varying and price-sensitive queueing model is formulated, where the customer behaviors are taken into account, such as balking and abandonment. To guarantee a preset service level, the probability of abandonment and expected delay are considered as the control targets, and the pricing for courier service and the maintained fleet size are considered simultaneously. For the low and moderate quality of service(QoS) target, a fluid control model is constructed with a closed-form solution. For the high QoS target, a modified approximation algorithm is designed to numerically tackle the problem. Based on the simulation, it is observed that the proposed approximation methods not only provide a high-quality joint strategy but also help stabilize the system performance. In addition, only mild price change is needed to reach the optimal condition, and a time lag exists between the optimal fleet sizing and the demand variation, which may shed light on the demand-driven fleet sizing under more general settings.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Frequency competition is critical for a full-service airline in gaining market share, and adopting a proper strategy can improve an airline’s profits. This study proposes a new equilibrium programming model with flow balance to address frequency competition on airports network with time slot constraints. We first show that a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium may not always exist, and thus forming a pure strategy profile in frequency competition among airlines may naturally lead to deviation from current frequency. Therefore, we formulate the problem as a programming model with a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. To avoid shocks from dramatic frequency changes across the network, airlines tend to fine-tune frequencies on select segments during each adjustment. We propose a procedure to generate a computationally tractable amount of representative strategies from a finite set of feasible strategies to demonstrate mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. We conduct an empirical analysis using an example in which industry profitability increased by as much as 7.89%. We then extend the model to formulate frequency competition among metal-neutral alliances. The results show that forming metal-neutral alliances can improve total industry profits by 10.59%. In particular, a sensitivity analysis with real data on the tolerance of flow imbalance demonstrates that deducting the potential costs due to the relaxation of flow balance between congested airports may earn additional total industry profits in a frequency competition.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>In a typical discrete manufacturing process,a new type of reconfigurable production line is introduced,which aims to help small-and mid-size enterprises to improve machine utilization and reduce production cost.In order to effectively handle the production scheduling problem for the manufacturing system,an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on Brownian motion(MOPSO-BM)is proposed.Since the existing MOPSO algorithms are easily stuck in the local optimum,the global search ability of the proposed method is enhanced based on the random motion mechanism of the BM.To further strengthen the global search capacity,a strategy of fitting the inertia weight with the piecewise Gaussian cumulative distribution function(GCDF)is included,which helps to maintain an excellent convergence rate of the algorithm.Based on the commonly used indicators generational distance(GD)and hypervolume(HV),we compare the MOPSO-BM with several other latest algorithms on the benchmark functions,and it shows a better overall performance.Furthermore,for a real reconfigurable production line of smart home appliances,three algorithms,namely non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II(NSGA-II),decomposition-based MOPSO(dMOPSO)and MOPSO-BM,are applied to tackle the scheduling problem.It is demonstrated that MOPSO-BM outperforms the others in terms of convergence rate and quality of solutions.</p>

      <p>Partner selection is critical to the success of a Virtual Enterprise. This paper studies the partner selection problem under the virtual organization breeding environment where candidates have private information about their cost to undertake the tasks. A systematic solution is provided to reveal the true value of the private information and then select the optimal partners. This solution mainly comprises two steps: (1) For each possible cost combination, a multi-objective integer nonlinear programming model and an algorithm are designed to obtain the optimal partners. Then, a social choice correspondence, which indicates the optimal partners for any cost combination, is formulated. (2) An incentive mechanism is constructed to implement the social choice correspondence and ensure that candidates will announce their values of cost truthfully. Furthermore, a numerical study is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the solution and to investigate the relationship between the construction of the collaborative network and the utility to partners. We find that the number of candidates in each period affects the utility of partners as well as the expected surplus of the leading company significantly.</p>

  </div>

  
  <a href="/publication/jiang-2021-spatial/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>With the rapid development of e-commerce and the new retail, the same-day or even same-half day delivery service is provided to compete for market share. Recently, an increased number of e-commerce companies implement the unmanned smart warehouses to improve the logistics efficiency. In order to further reduce the demand response time, a novel picking strategy is designed to firstly split the orders, and then assign the partial orders to different pickers. After all the order segments have been collected, it is shipped to the customer. Due to the inherent complexity of the problem, a two stage optimization model is introduced. In the first stage, an order splitting and batching strategy based on spatial measure is proposed. And a MIP model is constructed to minimize the total picking distance, which is then solved via a column generation based algorithm. In the second stage, the newly formed batches are considered as a priori inputs, which are then assigned to automatic pickers. The picking process is modeled as a special parallel machine scheduling problem with multiple due dates for a single item, which could reduce to a customer order scheduling problem on parallel machines, and it is unary NP-complete. A heuristic method is proposed to obtain an approximate solution. Although the order splitting technique is not new in the logistics industry, the split orders are picked according to a vehicle routing problem, which fails to address the kitting issue for fast turnovers. In the numerical analysis section, the proposed algorithm is validated through extensive testing on various scales of instances. It is observed that the optimality gap for our algorithm is within 9%, and the computation time is around 5 min. Also, the average turnover rate increases by approximately 50% in comparison with the no-splitting policy. In most cases, the average order tardiness decreases by 90% compared with order splitting and no-kitting policy.</p>

    <a href="/publication/pei-2020-approximation/">An Approximation Algorithm for Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Under TOU Electricity Tariffs</a>
  </div>

  
  <a href="/publication/pei-2020-approximation/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>In an era of sustainable development, considerable emphasis has been put onto energy saving, environment friendly, and social welfare as well as productivity in the manufacturing sector. In this work, an unrelated parallel manufacturing setting with time-of-use (TOU) electricity price is explored, with an aim to reduce the electricity cost and increase productivity simultaneously. A nonlinear mathematical programming model is formulated to exploit the special structure of the scheduling problem, where the quadratic constraints are reformulated as second-order-cone (SOC) constraints, and several tailored cutting planes are introduced to further tighten the feasible region of the problem. Then, the original scheduling problem is transformed into several single-machine scheduling problems with TOU electricity price, which could be relaxed as a single-objective programming problem, and it could be solved rapidly via commercial solvers, such as CPLEX. Based on the optimal solution of the relaxed problem, an approximate algorithm is proposed, where a special rounding technique is employed to assign jobs to the unrelated parallel machines in a local search manner. Furthermore, a lower bound model is constructed by eliminating the nonpreemption constraint, and an iteration-based algorithm is devised to obtain the optimal solution of the lower bound problem. Meanwhile, a dispatch rule-based approach is proposed to provide an upper bound of the scheduling problem with TOU constraint. In the numerical analysis section, the proposed approximate algorithm is validated through extensive testing on various scales of instances, different emphasis on productivity and electricity price, and under two typical TOU electricity pricing policies. It is observed that the gap between the proposed approximate algorithm and CPLEX is mostly within 4%, and the lower/upper bound methods could obtain a relaxed/feasible solution within 0.01 s. Note to Practitioners —Energy saving together with productivity improvement in the manufacturing system becomes the focus of both academia and industry over the years due to the increasing deterioration of the environment and the advancement of commercialization. In order to maintain better social welfare, the government usually makes time-of-use (TOU) electricity pricing policies to rebalance energy demand. For each manufacturing company, a tradeoff analysis should be performed to adapt to the TOU electricity price, so as to achieve the most desirable outcome. During the decision-making process, the practitioners should assign weights to the productivity and the energy cost to match their anticipation. For a typical manufacturing setting where all the machines are unrelated parallel, the proposed approximate algorithm, also known as the F-SOC algorithm, could be employed to obtain a near-optimal schedule within a short period of time. The proposed approximate algorithm could also work well in situations where the TOU electricity pricing policies are switching, and the preferences for productivity versus energy cost are swaying. A near-optimal schedule could always be guaranteed within a 4% gap from the optimal solution for most cases.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>In this paper, we analyze the impact of indirect network effects and competition on two firms each offering two complementary products. We first formulate the pricing game with general network effects and show that it is neither a supermodular nor a submodular game. We then derive the closed-form Nash equilibrium with linear demand functions. Furthermore, we examine a model with two symmetric firms each having a major product and a minor product, where the major product of one firm is the minor one of the other. We find that the impacts of network effects of major and minor products on the equilibrium prices are not symmetric. Moreover, as the substitution rate increases, the firm might partially sacrifice the major product market to boost the minor product market when the substitution rate is low and the network effect of the minor product is quite weak compared to that of the major product. Our numerical analysis shows that strong externalities between the two complementary products will benefit the firms. Finally, the models with symmetric product structures and generalized customer preference are analyzed to verify the robustness of the main results.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>There are many efficient and effective constraint-handling mechanisms for constrained optimization problems. However, most of them evaluate all the individuals, including the worse individuals, which waste a lot of fitness evaluations. In this paper, halfspace partition mechanism based on constraint violation values is proposed. Since constraint violation information of individuals in current generation are already known, the positive side of tangent line of one point as positive halfspace is defined. A point is treated as potential point if it locates in the intersect region of two positive halfspaces. Hence, the region includes all these points has greater possibility to obtain smaller constraint violation. Only when the offspring locates in this area, the actual objective function value and constraint violation will be calculated. The estimated worse individuals will be omitted without calculating actual constraint violation and fitness function value. Four engineering optimization and a case study with the grinding optimization process are studied. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.</p>

  </div>

  
  <a href="/publication/pei-2020-new/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>In the current study, an unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with release dates is considered, which is to obtain a job assignment with minimal sum of weighted completion times. Although this problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, which renders the optimality seeking a formidable task within polynomial time, a 4-approximation algorithm based on the constant worst-case bound is devised and proved in comparison with the existing 16/3-approximation (Hall et al. in Math Oper Res 22(3):513–544, 1997). In the newly proposed algorithm, the original scheduling problem is divided into several sub-problems based on release dates. For each sub-problem, a convex quadratic integer programming model is constructed in accordance with the specific problem structure. Then a semi-definite programming approach is implemented to produce a lower bound via the semi-definite relaxation of each sub-problem. Furthermore, by considering the binary constraint, a branch and bound based method and a local search strategy are applied separately to locate the optimal solution of each sub-problem. Then the solution of the original scheduling problem is derived by integrating the outcomes of the sub-problems via the proposed approximation algorithm. In the numerical analysis, it is discovered that the proposed methods could always obtain a scheduling result within 1% of the optimal solution. And an asymptotic trend could be observed where the quality of solutions improves even further as the scale of the scheduling problem increases.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Diversity multi-criteria decision-making methods have been developed to address different complex decision-making problems, and the analytic network process has been found to be one of the most effective techniques. There is an increase in the quality and quantity of publications related to the analytic network process. This detailed overview can provide the research status and development characteristics of analytic network process research and will be useful to researchers for future research directions. To achieve these goals, bibliometric techniques were used. In addition, past and present hotspots of analytic network process research were concluded, and future research trends were determined. The bibliometric analysis was carried out from various aspects including countries and regions, institutions, journals, authors, research areas, articles and author keywords based on data harvested from the Web of Science database. There were 1485 analytic network process-related publications retrieved from the Web of Science. The results show that Expert Systems with Applications was the most productive journal publishing articles in analytic network process research (118); its number of publications has decreased dramatically since 2013, while Journal of Cleaner Production has shown an upward trend in recent years and ranks second with 47 publications. The most collaborative country is the United States. Taiwan takes a leading position in analytic network process research with 436 publications (29.36%), and National Chiao Tung University, which is located in Taiwan, produced the most articles and has gained the highest h-index (28). The major hot topics that employ analytic network process are sustainability, environmental management and supply chain management. These topics may continue to attract more attention in the future.</p>

  <a href="/publication/pei-2020-column/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Job shop scheduling, as one of the classical scheduling problems, has been widely studied in literatures, and proved to be mostly NP-hard. Although it is extremely difficult to solve job shop scheduling with no-wait constraint to optimality, the two-machine no-wait job shop scheduling to minimise makespan could be solvable in polynomial time when each job has exactly two equal length operations (proportionate job shop). In the present paper, an extension is attempted by considering a proportionate flexible two-stage no-wait job shop scheduling problem with minimum makespan, and a set-covering formulation is put forward which contains a master problem and a pricing problem. To solve this problem, a column generation (CG)-based approach is implemented. In comparison, a mixed integer programming model is constructed and optimised by Cplex. A series of randomly generated numerical instances are calculated. And the testing result shows that the mixed integer model handled by Cplex can only solve small scale cases, while the proposed CG-based method can conquer larger size problems in acceptable time.</p>

  </div>

  
  <a href="/publication/wang-2018-optimal/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Making an appointment is an effective way to balance the supply and demand in service industries. However, people may not show up for their appointments at the scheduled time. Undoubtedly, sending a reminder to ask for a clear response for each appointment can lower the no-show rate and provide more time for service providers to perform other activities. Therefore, the most important variable is to determine when the reminders should to be sent. In this paper, we study the optimal appointment reminder sending strategy for a single service scenario with customer no-show behaviour. Through discretising the decision process, a dynamic programming model is formulated. Then the optimal time to send a reminder for each appointment is calculated. We prove that there exists an optimal time to send a reminder for each appointment and that the earlier an appointment is made, the earlier a reminder should be sent. Furthermore, our numerical studies show that there exists an optimal appointment time window for a service with a given arrival rate and no-show rate. In addition, the higher the no-show rate of a customer is, the later a reminder should be sent. Based on the optimal reminder sending strategy, the expected service utilisation can be improved compared to no reminders or sending reminders 24 h before the scheduled time. Especially, the increase in the expected service utilisation rate becomes more significant when the arrival rate decreases and the no-show rate increases.</p>

      <p>Differential evolution (DE) is one of the best evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The effort of improving its performance has received great research attentions, such as adaptive DE (JADE). Based on the analysis on the aspects that may improve the performance of JADE, we introduce a modified JADE version with sorting crossover rate (CR). In JADE, CR values are generated based on mean value and Gaussian distribution. In the proposed algorithm, a smaller CR value is assigned to individual with better fitness value. Therefore, the components of the individuals, which have better fitness values, can appear in the offspring with higher possibility. In addition, the better offspring generated from last iteration are supposed to have better schemes, hence these schemes are preserved in next offspring generation procedure. This modified version is called as JADE algorithm with sorting CR (JADE_sort). The experiments results with several excellent algorithms show the effectiveness of JADE_sort.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Traditionally, the linguistic variable based decision making mainly employs linguistic cardinalities with uniformly distributed scales. Within such scaling systems, the verbal information could be illustrated by multiple forms, such as the extended linguistic scale values and the 2-tuple linguistic representation. In general, the fundamental procedure to implement such methods involves the translation of the experts’ verbal judgements into computable linguistic variables, the arithmetic operations of the linguistic variables, and the transformation of the derived outcomes back to the verbal terms. Meanwhile, still many experts prefer presenting their linguistic assessments on an unevenly distributed cardinality in contrast with the evenly distributed sets. In light of the mission “computing with words”, it is essential to design a unified way to model the linguistic scale sets with both evenly and unevenly distributed cardinalities. Since the normal distribution serves as a decent tool to model the subjective judgements, in the present paper, a series of normal distribution based unbalanced linguistic scale sets are constructed. Besides, the area blocks under the distribution curve are applied to bridge the unbalanced linguistic variables and their relative coordinates. Furthermore, a novel 3-tuple format of unbalanced linguistic variable representation is proposed. The 3-tuple model is a generalized form of the linguistic information, and it could further degenerate to its 2-tuple linguistic counterpart. Finally, two numerical examples are included to demonstrate the validity of the proposed unbalanced linguistic variable based models and the 3-tuple linguistic information representation approach.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) point operators transform an intuitionistic fuzzy set to a fuzzy set, or an intuitionistic fuzzy set with a smaller degree of hesitance. The purpose of which is to empower the operations of intuitionistic fuzzy sets with traditional fuzzy set methodologies. In the present paper, a new IF point operator is proposed. Different from the existing IF point operators, the new approach includes two parametric functions with respect to the number of iterations. It is proved that the newly proposed method could be degenerated to the traditional IF point operators. Meanwhile, the new IF point operator can extend our horizons in the exploration of the relationship between fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Specifically, a special case of the new IF point operator would be entitled as the memoryless multi-stage voting method, with which the decision makers are assumed to be affected only by the outcomes of the latest round of voting. It is proved that the memoryless multi-stage voting method converges to the limit produced by the infinite number of iterations much faster than the traditional voting method. Furthermore, a numerical example is employed to demonstrate the validity and performance of the memoryless multi-stage voting approach.</p>

      <p>This paper proposes an effective Memetic Algorithm (MA) for the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) with the objective of minimising the makespan. The proposed MA is a combination of TABU Search (TS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). This hybridisation presents an effective way of performing both exploration and exploitation by incorporating the local search abilities of TS with the global reaching capabilities of GA. The approach provides an effective encoding method, genetic operators and neighbourhood structure in order to effectively solve the FJSP. To evaluate the performance of the proposed MA, several benchmark instances of FJSP have been used. The experimental results show that the proposed MA is a very effective method for solving FJSP.</p>

      <p>Many engineering problems can be categorized into constrained optimization problems (COPs). The engineering design optimization problem is very important in engineering industries. Because of the complexities of mathematical models, it is difficult to find a perfect method to solve all the COPs very well. 𝜀 constrained differential evolution (𝜀DE) algorithm is an effective method in dealing with the COPs. However, 𝜀DE still cannot obtain more precise solutions. The interaction between feasible and infeasible individuals can be enhanced, and the feasible individuals can lead the population finding optimum around it. Hence, in this paper we propose a new algorithm based on 𝜀 feasible individuals driven local search called as 𝜀 constrained differential evolution algorithm with a novel local search operator (𝜀DE-LS). The effectiveness of the proposed 𝜀DE-LS algorithm is tested. Furthermore, four real-world engineering design problems and a case study have been studied. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is a very effective method for the presented engineering design optimization problems.</p>

      <p>Differential evolution (DE), which is one of the most popular evolution algorithms, has received much attention from researchers and engineers. In DE, mutation operation has a great impact on the performance of the algorithm. It generates mutant vectors by adding difference vectors to the base vector. Obviously, the chosen vectors in the mutation operation should not be equal to each other or to the target vector. This paper designs four experiments to analyze this session of DE and tries to determine whether this constraint is necessary. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that without this constraint, the DE algorithm may perform better or at least not worse. Moreover, based on the experimental results, we can also summarize some rules for when and how to use this constraint to enhance the performance of the DE algorithm. This can help researchers to improve or apply the DE algorithm well.</p>

      <p>A novel differential evolution algorithm based on adaptive differential evolution algorithm is proposed by implementing pbest roulette wheel selection and retention mechanism. Motivated by the observation that individuals with better function values can generate better offspring, we propose a fitness function value based pbest selection mechanism. The generated offspring with better fitness function value indicates that the pbest vector of current individual is suitable for exploitation, so the pbest vector should be retained into the next generation. This modification is used to avoid the individual gather around the pbest vector, thus diversify the population. The performance of the proposed algorithm is extensively evaluated both on the 25 famous benchmark functions and four real-world application problems.

      <p>Many real-world problems can be categorized as constrained optimization problems. So, designing effective algorithms for constrained optimization problems become more and more important. In designing algorithms, how to guide the individuals moving more efficiently towards the feasible region is one of the most important aspects on finding the optimum of constrained optimization problems. In this paper, we propose an improved ε constrained differential evolution, which combines with pre-estimated comparison gradient based approximation. The proposed algorithm uses gradient matrix to determine whether the trail vector generated by differential evolution algorithm is worth using the fitness function to evaluate it or not. Pre-estimated comparison gradient based approximation is used as a detector to find the promising offspring and in this way can we guide the individuals moving towards the feasible region. The proposed method is tested both on twenty-four benchmark functions and four well-known engineering optimization problems. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive in comparing with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed algorithm offers higher accuracy in engineering optimization problems for constrained optimization problems.</p>

      <p>Generally, in handling traditional scheduling problems, ideal manufacturing system environments are assumed before determining effective scheduling. Unfortunately, “ideal environments” are not always possible. Real systems often encounter some uncertainties which will change the status of manufacturing systems. These may cause the original schedule to no longer to be optimal or even feasible. Traditional scheduling methods are not effective in coping with these cases. Therefore, a new scheduling strategy called “inverse scheduling” has been proposed to handle these problems. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to provide a comprehensive mathematical model for multi-objective permutation flow-shop inverse scheduling problem (PFISP). In this paper, first, a PFISP mathematical model is devised and an effective hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to handle uncertain processing parameters (uncertainties) and multiple objectives at the same time. In the proposed algorithm, we take an insert method NEH-based (Nawaz–Enscore–Ham) as a local improving procedure and propose several adaptations including efficient initialization, decimal system encoding, elitism and population diversity. Finally, 119 public problem instances with different scales and statistical performance comparisons are provided for the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the traditional multi-objective evolution algorithm (MOEA) in terms of searching quality, diversity level and efficiency. This paper is the first to propose a mathematical model and develop a hybrid MOEA algorithm to solve PFISP in inverse scheduling domain.</p>

  </div>

  
  <a href="/publication/pei-2015-note/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>The TOPSIS method, commonly known as the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions, is one of the most popular approaches used in multi-attribute decision making (MADM). The fundamental procedure of the traditional TOPSIS method is rather straightforward, the ranking position of an alternative depends on its relative closeness to the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution, respectively. In order to encompass uncertain and ambiguous decision elements, an extension of the original TOPSIS method has been coined. With the help of fuzzy sets based TOPSIS, an overwhelming trend of fuzzy decision making applications has been witnessed. In the present work, however, it is found that the extended fuzzy TOPSIS method is unable to distinguish all the different alternatives under linguistic environment. Moreover, the undistinguishable alternatives are countless in quantity, and they have formed specific patterns with respect to the parameters of TOPSIS methods. To dampen this ranking ambiguity, we designed a set of supplemental methods to construct a revised TOPSIS approach with linguistic evaluations. Correspondingly, the sufficiency of the revised TOPSIS method to guarantee total orders has been proven. Furthermore, a numerical example concerning the production line improvement of a manufacturing company is demonstrated to validate the feasibility and supremacy of the proposed method. Finally, a series of further discussions are performed to shed some lights on the impacts caused by the changes of the alternative quantity, the attribute quantity, and the type of linguistic term.</p>

  <a href="/publication/gao-2015-multi/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Solving constrained optimization problems (COPs) has been gathering attention from many researchers. In this paper, we defined the best fitness value among feasible solutions in current population as gbest. Then, we converted the original COPs to multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) with one constraint. The constraint set the function value f(x) should be less than or equal to gbest; the objectives are the constraints in COPs. A reverse comparison strategy based on multi-objective dominance concept is proposed. Compared with usual strategies, the innovation strategy cuts off the worse solutions with smaller fitness value regardless of its constraints violation. Differential evolution (DE) algorithm is used as a solver to search for the global optimum. The method is called multi-objective optimization based reverse strategy with differential evolution algorithm (MRS-DE). The experimental results demonstrate that MRS-DE can achieve better performance on 22 classical benchmark functions compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

  </div>

  
  <a href="/publication/yi-2015-new/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>The differential evolution (DE) algorithm is a notably powerful evolutionary algorithm that has been applied in many areas. Therefore, the question of how to improve the algorithm’s performance has attracted considerable attention from researchers. The mutation operator largely impacts the performance of the DE algorithm The control parameters also have a significant influence on the performance. However, it is not an easy task to set a suitable control parameter for DE. One good method is to consider the mutation operator and control parameters simultaneously. Thus, this paper proposes a new DE algorithm with a hybrid mutation operator and self-adapting control parameters. To enhance the searching ability of the DE algorithm, the proposed method categorizes the population into two parts to process different types of mutation operators and self-adapting control parameters embedded in the proposed algorithm framework. Two famous benchmark sets (including 46 functions) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and comparisons with various other DE variants previously reported in the literature have also been conducted. Experimental results and statistical analysis indicate that the proposed algorithm has good performance on these functions</p>

  </div>

  
  <a href="/publication/pei-2013-simplification/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>In the flexible production line evaluation process, fuzzy multiple attribute decision making is frequently employed to resist the ambiguous and incomplete information. And large amount of time and cost have been paid to gather the information so as to construct the decision matrix. Besides, the computational efforts spent in deriving the ranking orders of the alternatives grow rapidly as the number of attributes increases. However, in a typical fuzzy decision making problem with multi-attributes, not all of the attributes are necessary to reach the final decision. Redundant attributes are inevitable, especially when the problem is large-scaled and complicated. In this paper, we will introduce the simplification theory and techniques in fuzzy multiple attribute decision making problems, which incur great costs especially in the production line evaluation process. To solve this problem, two attribute reduction algorithms are proposed. The purpose of the algorithms is to attain all of the simplified order-preserving attribute subsets and the order-preserving attribute core subset of the corresponding multiple attribute decision making problem. Then one of the simplest order-preserving attribute subsets will be employed as a substitute of the original attribute set. Furthermore, via comparison, dissimilarities between the attribute reduction in decision making and the knowledge reduction in rough set theory are discovered. Finally, a case study concerning production line evaluation is analyzed in depth to demonstrate our approach, and also a sensitivity analysis is conducted to reflect the robustness of each attribute reduct.</p>

  <a href="/publication/pei-2013-rational/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>In the age of mass customization with service oriented manufacturing, more and more production lines are designed according to the frequently changing customer demands. In order to improve upon the flexible production lines, rapid assessment tools have to be developed and implemented. Since uncertain information and incomplete knowledge coexist inevitably in the rapid assessment process, in literature, fuzzy multi-attribute decision making models are established to handle them simultaneously. However, very few papers have paid adequate attention to the decision maker’s rationality, i.e., the optimism level of the decision maker. Therefore, in this paper, a series of novel rational decision making models are developed in dealing with the multi-attribute assessment problems, which include incomplete preference information. And the evaluating data are expressed under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy settings. Compared with the traditional distance-based method, correlation coefficient between each alternative and the ideal solution with (α, β) optimism level is applied. Furthermore, confidence level and cognitive dissonance of the decision maker are included in the overall decision making process in order to constitute a more comprehensive evaluation of the flexible production line. Besides, several insights are revealed concerning the levels of optimism and the weights of production line attributes. Finally, a three-stage empirical study is conducted to validate the proposed models, compare them with the traditional distance-based methods, and the result shows that our approach is not only valid but also outperforms the traditional methods.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>This paper studies a dynamic pricing problem for a monopolist selling multiple identical items to potential buyers arriving over time, where the time horizon is infinite, the goods are imperishable and the buyers’ arrival follows a renewal process. Each potential buyer has some private information about his purchasing will, and this private information is unknown to the seller and therefore characterized as a random variable in this paper. Thus, the buyers may have multi-unit demand. Meanwhile, the seller needs to determine the optimal posted price such that his expected discounted revenue is maximized. This problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic programming in this paper and then how to obtain the solution is explored. A numerical study shows that the optimal posted price performs better than that of optimal fixed price, and this advantage becomes obvious as the interest rate and/or the number of initial items increases.</p>
